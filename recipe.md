How to Make Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies
1) Start with Butter: Use room temperature butter. 

2) Use a mix of Sugars: Cream the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together. This process aerates the butter, which promises soft chocolate chip cookies. Brown sugar yields soft chocolate chip cookies and white sugar helps the cookies spread. For chewier and more flavorful cookies, use more brown sugar than white sugar.

3) Add Egg & Vanilla Extract: Eggs provide structure and richness, while vanilla adds flavor.

4) Use Cornstarch in Dry Ingredients: Cornstarch, a thickening ingredient, 2 teaspoons give the cookies extra lift and leave them extra soft. You can’t taste it! You also need all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.

5) Add Dry Ingredients to Wet Ingredients: Combine all the ingredients, then add the chocolate chips.

6) Chill the Cookie Dough: For extra thick chocolate chip cookies, chill the cookie dough for at least 1 hour. Chilling cookie dough will make or break the recipe! The colder the cookie dough, the less the cookies will over-spread. 

7) Extra Chocolate Chips: This is optional, but as soon as the cookies come out of the oven, press a few chocolate chips on top. They’ll melt right down into the cookie, making them extra pretty.
